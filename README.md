Our signature approach blends realistic, hands-on experience with critical theoretical knowledge, ensuring your organization is prepared for any emergency.

Our Services

1. Tailor-Made Exercises:
Crisotech develops immersive, fictitious crisis scenarios where participants actively engage in managing simulated crises. Each scenario is crafted with multiple inputs across tactical, operational, and strategic levels, simulating real-world conditions on various themes such as cyber crisis, industrial accidents, terrorism, natural disasters, and social crises.

- Key Focus:
  - Shared Trust: Building confidence among team members.
  - Stress Management: Handling high-pressure situations effectively.
  - Decision-Making in Emergencies: Making informed decisions quickly.

2. Major Exercises:
- Test coordination and information sharing between multiple organizations or internal entities.
- Utilize diverse communication channels (SMS, calls, emails, intranets, dedicated software).

3. Restricted Exercises:
- Focus on internal crisis unit operations, task allocation, information processing, and decision-making processes.

4. Tabletop Exercises:
- Simulated closed-environment crise exercises with external stakeholder roles played by Crisotech, including field teams, first responders, and media.

5. Field Exercises:
- Practical tests of procedures like evacuation, confinement, or assistance for operational teams.

6. Cyber Crisis Exercises:
- Comprehensive preparation for handling cyber crises with a 360° approach.
- Involvement of general management's crisis unit, technical units (SSI – SOC), and communication unit.
- Simulated media and societal pressure.
- Forensic investigation training options available.
- Incident response strategy and remediation.
- Hot and cold feedback sessions for continuous improvement.

Mediatraining

1. Media Communication Training:
- Training for media interaction in and out of crises.
- Blend of theoretical insights and practical exercises.
- Personalised guidance on effective communication, stress reduction, and message delivery.

2. TV Studio Training:
- Real-life conditions simulation with professional equipment including:
  - Cameras, microphones, lighting kits, TV mixers, and audio/video monitors.
- Ideal for crisis simulation exercises and mediatraining.

Fictitious Environment Simulation

Crisotech creates realistic scenarios with defined missions, objectives, geographical contexts, economic and media settings, and workforce. This immersive approach familiarizes participants with crisis unit functionalities, roles, coordination needs, and the utility of situation reports.

Applications:
   - Practice handling situations such as industrial action, attacks, natural disasters, or foodborne illnesses (TIAC).

Conclusion

With Biosoc’s crisis simulation training and exercises, your teams will gain invaluable experience and skills to manage crises effectively. Our realistic, action-oriented training modules ensure preparedness for any emergency situation, fostering shared trust, improving stress management, and enhancing decision-making abilities.
